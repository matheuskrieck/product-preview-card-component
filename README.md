## The challenge

This HTML & CSS-only challenge will be perfect for anyone starting to build responsive projects.
Your users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## Built with 

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive Web Design

## What I learned
Quite easy project to practice using HTML & CSS, but I had to figure something out to change the mobile picture to the desktop one, when the resolution changes.
